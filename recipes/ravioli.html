                        Dip 1 ravioli into beaten egg mixture, then into bread crumb mixture, pressing to coat.
                        Place ravioli on a plate and repeat with remaining ravioli. 
                        Lightly spray ravioli with cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Place as many ravioli in the air fryer basket as you can without overlapping them.</li>
